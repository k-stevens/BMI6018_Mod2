# Jack has 5 medications, so we will create a Medication variable and set it equal to 5
Medication= 5
# The Medication variable is used as a number so it is either an integer or a float
# Because it is a whole number (assuming you can't have a fraction of a medication) it is an integer
# It would still technically work as a float, but is unnecessary and would take up a lot more space than needed
# Therefore we will print the variable and the type
print("The variable 'Medication' is an integer and is equal to " + str(medications) + ".")
