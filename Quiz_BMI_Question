# Defined a variable for weight in kg
kg=60
# Defined a variable for height in m
meter=1.58
# Created a BMI variable, calculated it using weight/(height^2) (in kg and m)
# Made sure the numbers are floats because they have decimals
bmi=float(kg)/(float(meter)**2)
# Once the BMI is calculated, just need to print the output by converting to a string and adding to another string
print("The BMI is " + str(bmi))

# If I wanted to make this an input based program to compute any BMI
# replace kg variable with:
# kg=input("What is your weight in kilograms?")
# replace meter variable with:
# meter=input("What is your height in meters?")
# replace print output with
# print("Your BMI is " + str(bmi))
