# Jack has 5 medications, so we will create a Medication variable and set it equal to 5
Medication= 5
# The Medication variable is used as a number so it is either an integer or a float
# Because it is a whole number (assuming you can't have a fraction of a medication) it is an integer
# It would still technically work as a float, but is unnecessary and would take up a lot more space than needed
# Therefore we will print the variable and the type
# The type() function will tell us which type of variable this is
print(type(Medication))
print("The variable 'Medication' is " + str(type(Medication)) + " and is equal to " + str(Medication) + ".")
print("The variable 'Medication' is an integer" + " and is equal to " + str(Medication) + ".")
# I wasn't sure if we were supposed to show the type of variable through string or the type() function, so I did both
